Hello!

I'm currently a second year student at Victoria University of Wellington, studying mathematics and statistics. 
I took a compulsory computer science course in my first year and enjoyed it so much that I'm now spending my own free time playing around with various languages. 
Currently learning Haskell and a little Clojure, and working on some projects in Java.
